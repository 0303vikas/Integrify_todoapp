## Requirements
* title should be unique
* status is one of 3 options : `["not started", "in progress", "done"]`
* form to add/edit tasks should be opened/closed by clicking on a button (see the screenshot)
* deploy your project to github page and provide link to your live server in README. Make sure your README file is informative and codes are well-formatted
